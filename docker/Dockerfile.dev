# Dockerfile to setup neo-python on the development branch.
# https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/tree/master/docker
#
# Building (these commands create a Docker image called neopython-dev):
#
#    $ docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t neopython-dev .
#
# Build without caching:
#
#    $ docker build --no-cache -f Dockerfile.dev -t neopython-dev .
#
# At this point there is a Docker image called 'neopython-dev'. If you want to run it connecting
# to a private network, make sure the privatenet container is already running.
# https://hub.docker.com/r/cityofzion/neo-privatenet
#
# Start a container interactively, opening a bash in `/neo-python`, and mounting the current directory as `/neo-python/sc`:
#
#    $ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/neo-python/sc --net=host -h neopython-dev --name neopython-dev neopython-dev /bin/bash
#
# Once you are inside the container, you can start neo-python with `python3 prompt.py -p` (using -p to connect to a private net).
# To update neo-python, just run `git pull` and `pip install -e .`
