This package was once a standalone component, therefore you'll find some code here that also exists in neo-python(-core).
This code is mostly typed and applies Python naming conventions whereas the original code does not. At some point we should migrate and merge it all together.
At that time we have to make sure that the neo-python-core updates to e.g. BinaryReader are also applied here. Now they have no real effect.
