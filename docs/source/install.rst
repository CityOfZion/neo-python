Installation
------------

You will need to install the libleveldb library. Install `Python 3.5 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/>`_ to make sure you don't run into any issues with your version of Python being different than the current maintainer's version. Note that Python 3.6 is not currently supported due to incompatibilities with the byteplay module.

Installation via ``pip`` is not currently available at this time

You should install platform specific items before installing from git.



Install from Git
================

Clone the repository at `https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/ <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/>`_ and navigate into the project directory.
Make a Python 3 virtual environment and activate it via

::

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

or to explicitly install Python 3.5,

::

    virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.5 venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Then install the requirements via

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Finally, install a reference to the `neo` working directory, in order to be able to `import neo` from
anywhere in the project (eg. examples):

::

    pip install -e .


Updating neo-python from Git
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you are updating neo-python with ``git pull``, make sure you also update the dependencies with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.


Bootstrapping the Blockchain
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you use neo-python for the first time, you need to synchronize the blockchain, which may take a long time. Included in this project is ``bootstrap.py`` to automatically download a chain directory for you. To bootstrap for testnet, run ``python bootstrap.py``, get a cup of coffee and wait. To bootstrap for mainnet, use ``python bootstrap.py -m`` and get 8 cups of coffee (3.3 GB file).


Platform Specific Instructions
==============================

OSX
"""

::

    brew install leveldb

Ubuntu/Debian
"""""""""""""

::

    apt-get install libleveldb-dev python3.5-dev python3-pip libssl-dev


Centos/Redhat/Fedora
""""""""""""""""""""

This is a bit more tricky. You may need to enable the epel repo for the leveldb-devel package, which you can do by editing ``/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo``.

::

    yum -y install development tools python35 python35-devel python35-pip readline-devel leveldb-devel libffi-devel


Windows
"""""""
This has not been tested at this time. Installing the Python package plyvel seems to require C++ compiler support tied to Visual Studio and libraries.


Further Install Notes
=====================

For all of these, make sure that the ``Chains`` directory in your project has the proper write permissions

Common issues on OSX
""""""""""""""""""""

If you're having an issue similar to this:

.. code-block:: sh

    from ._plyvel import (  # noqa
    ImportError: dlopen(neo-python/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/plyvel/_plyvel.cpython-35m-darwin.so, 2): Symbol not found: __ZN7leveldb2DB4OpenERKNS_7Options
    ERKSsPPS0_
    Referenced from: neo-python/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/plyvel/_plyvel.cpython-35m-darwin.so
    Expected in: flat namespace

**Solution**: Update to plyvel 1.0.4: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

-----

You may also encounter issues when installing the pycrypto module on OSX:

.. code-block:: sh

    src/_fastmath.c:36:11: fatal error: 'gmp.h' file not found
    # include <gmp.h>
              ^~~~~~~
    330 warnings and 1 error generated.
    error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1

This may be fixed by installing the gmp library using homebrew and running pip install with the following commandline:

.. code-block:: sh

    brew install gmp
    CFLAGS='-mmacosx-version-min=10.7 -stdlib=libc++' pip install --no-use-wheel pycrypto --no-cache-dir --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.1.2/include/" --global-option="-L/usr/local/lib"

-----

``import scrypt`` / ``Reason: image not found``

If you encounter an error like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    import scrypt
    File "/project_dir/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scrypt.py", line 11, in
    _scrypt = cdll.LoadLibrary(imp.find_module('_scrypt')[1])
    File "/project_dir/venv/lib/python3.5/ctypes/init.py", line 429, in LoadLibrary
    return self._dlltype(name)
    File "/project_dir/venv/lib/python3.5/ctypes/init.py", line 351, in init
    self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode)
    OSError: dlopen(/project_dir/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/_scrypt.cpython-35m-darwin.so, 6): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib
    Referenced from: /project_dir/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/_scrypt.cpython-35m-darwin.so
    Reason: image not found

The solution probably is

.. code-block:: sh

    brew reinstall openssl
