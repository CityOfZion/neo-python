Overview

Neo-python is an implementation of the Neo protocol using Python. 



This project aims to be:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A full node implementation compatible with `Neo blockchain <https://github.com/neo-project/neo/tree/master-2.x>`_.
- A Command Line Interface (CLI) for node configuration and blockchain inspection.
- Smart Contracts development tool using `neo-boa <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-boa>`_, debugging and deployment using the command line.
- `RPC Client <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python-rpc>`_ and RPC Server.
- Notification server with optional REST endpoints (for viewing transfers of NEP5 tokens).
- ``Runtime.Log`` and ``Runtime.Notify`` event monitoring.
- `NEP2 <https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-2.mediawiki>`_ and `NEP5 <https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-5.mediawiki>`_ compliant wallet.
