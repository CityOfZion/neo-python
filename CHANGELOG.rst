[0.6.2-dev] in progress
-----------------------
- Implementing interop type ``MAP`` along with new opcodes ``NEWMAP HASKEY KEYS VALUES`` and modify ``ARRAYSIZE PICKITEM SETITEM REMOVE`` to support ``MAP`` as `per PR here <https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm/pull/28>__`

- Added TransactionInvocation.GetScript to ``StateReader.py``
- Fixed missing uri locations in ``neo/api/REST/RestApi.py`` (`PR #342 <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/pull/342>`_)
- Fixed privatenet check by fixing the chain path for checks in Settings (`PR #341 <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/pull/341>`_)
- Fixed ``neo-privnet.sample.wallet``
- Fixed ``bootstrap.py`` to use the specified data directory, instead of hard-coded relative paths.


[0.6.1] 2018-03-16
----------------------------
- Fixed README reference in ``MANIFEST.in``
- Added additional error messages to ``ExecutionEngine.py`` to help with debugging smart contracts.
- Changes for Pypi compatibility:
  - move protocol.*.json to ``neo/data/``
  - move ``prompt.py`` and other scripts to ``neo/bin``
  - default chain data path is now in ``~/.neopython/Chains``.  ``prompt.log`` and ``prompt.history`` files are also stored there
  - the following console scripts are now on the ``venv`` path after running ``pip install neo-python`` or ``pip install -e .`` for github based installs:
    - ``np-prompt``
    - ``np-api-server``
    - ``np-bootstrap``
    - ``np-reencrypt-wallet``
  - updated docs for Pypi changes


[0.5.7] 2018-03-14
----------------------------
- update to ``neocore==0.3.8``
- Fixed README reference in ``MANIFEST.in``, add pypi badge to readme
- Add ability to specify ``--datadir`` path for where leveldb directories are stored
- Tries to auto-create ``Chains`` directory in ``--datadir`` if it doesnt exist
- Add scripts to be exported for package install.  ``np_prompt``, ``np_api_server``, ``np_bootstrap``, and ``np_reencrypt_wallet`` available as commands after ``pip`` install
- add protocol.*.json into data package
- move ``neo-privnet.wallet`` to ``neo-privnet.sample.wallet`` and .gitignore ``neo-privnet.wallet``
- Change ``README.md`` to `README.rst``


[0.5.4] 2018-03-14
------------------
- All requests to the API that are invalid will now receive a ``None`` for results rather than an empty list ``[]``
- update to neo-boa==0.3.7
- `api-server.py <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/development/api-server.py>`_: Improved logging setup. See the options with ``./api-server.py -h``
- Added ``sc-debug-notify`` option to the ``config`` console command. This preserves smart contract ``Notify()`` events when SC execution fails and is intended for SC debugging purposes only.
- Added VM instruction counter to ``ExecutionEngine.py`` error messages to indicate the final instruction that failed. Allows for setting conditional breakpoints to support SC debugging.
- Renamed ``neo.api.REST.NotificationRestApi`` to ``neo.api.REST.RestApi``
- Added ``-v/--verbose`` argument to prompt.py, which makes prompt.py show smart contract events by default
- Added ``vm-log`` option to the ``config`` console command. This enabled logging of VM instructions to ``vm_instructions.log`` for debugging purposes.
- Fix multi-signature contract import to allow using a single signature
- Fix fund sending from multi-signature contract
- Added instructions on retrieving NEO TestNet funds
- Fixed issue with missing ``notifications/`` prefix for ``addr`` call in ``neo/api/REST/RestApi.py``
- Added ``neo-privnet.wallet`` to the project root. This is the standard wallet for `private networks <https://hub.docker.com/r/cityofzion/neo-privatenet/>`_.
- prompt.py: When using a privnet with ``-p``, check if chain database is correct. Renamed ``Chains/Priv_Notif`` to ``Chains/privnet_notif`` (if you need your old privnet notification db, you need to rename it manually).
- Optionally allow to use custom privnet hosts with ``-p`` (`PR #312 <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/pull/312>`_)
- Added a dependency check to ``Settings.py``, which verifies that the installed dependencies match those in requirements.txt


[0.5.3] 2018-03-04
------------------
- add documentation for data types in ``neo-python``
- add intructions on ``build``, ``build .. test``, ``import contract``, and ``testinvoke`` to docs
